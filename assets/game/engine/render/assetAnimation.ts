/**
 * ASSET ANIMATION — the render-side bridge between the pure animation ENGINE (`tileAnimation`) and the
 * three view renderers (iso / 2D / top). ONE place resolves a placed asset's live per-frame overrides,
 * gated by each animation's `scope{styles,views}`, so every view applies the SAME values consistently.
 *
 * Clock-derived + stateless (exactly like `cellAnimation`): the renderer reads the RAF clock each frame and
 * calls `resolveAssetAnimation`; nothing is stored between frames. Returns `null` — the cheap, allocation-free
 * path — when the asset has NO animations, none match the active (style, view) scope, or they contribute no
 * settings (e.g. only `sprite` animations, whose playback is stubbed in Phase 1). That null case is what keeps
 * an un-animated tile's render BYTE-IDENTICAL to before this system existed.
 *
 * Split of concerns: `opacity` (a multiplier onto the tile's base alpha) and the screen POSITION shift
 * (`x`/`y`, in tile fractions — `y` positive = a RISE / lift UP) are applied by the caller at the canvas
 * level (globalAlpha + translate), because they must work uniformly in every view's own coordinate space.
 * The remaining live settings that map 1:1 onto plain `GridAsset` fields (colour, zoom, width, height) are
 * COMPOSED onto the tile's BASE value on a shallow-cloned `asset` (`fx.asset`) — an animation LAYERS on top of
 * the base slider, it does not mask it (Image #40): height ADDS its delta-from-start onto `scaleY`, zoom/width
 * MULTIPLY the base by their ratio-from-start, colour is last-wins. So the base height/zoom sliders stay live
 * and editable while an animation plays, and the existing draw code reads the composed fields with no changes.
